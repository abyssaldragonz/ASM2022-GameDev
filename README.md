## ðŸš€ About
This is a comprehensive compilation of my work done at After School Matters (ASM) Advanced Game Design internship from the summer of 2022. The content itself has not changed since then but there have been fixes to make this showcase a little more functional and viewable. <br>

The ASM program focused on understanding and learning about game design, on both the creative world building (design) and the back-end developemnt of game mechanics (software). In addition to individual game ideas, world building using other mediums, such as illustration or creative writing, were encouraged. Each participant had a promotional site created by the program instructor/facilitator, to showcase their work and projects done over the season; I was allowed to, and encouraged, to build my own showcase profile using HTML and CSS. <br>

`\website-graphics` folder consists of various graphics included in the profile. 3D models (created with SculptGL), game sprite sketches (created with Piskel), game layout sketches (done digitally in Krita), screenshots of work in progress code and ideas (programmed in Construct 3), etc. <br> <br>
`index.html` file is the main showcase profile created with HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. Best viewed on desktops. Previously hosted at `https://ecbrown.org/asm2/promotions/josephine` (link is no longer available) <br> <br>
`the-beginning.html` file is the interactive storyTwine (created with Twine) that goes along with the main game. While the main game itself is not fully complete, this branching storyline is a rough outline of what the final story within the game will be like. Best viewed on desktops. <br>
